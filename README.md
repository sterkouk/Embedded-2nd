# Embedded Systems 2nd Exercise
We were asked to create a program in C that would do regular
sampling with the smallest possible deviation from real time. By
restriction that after the program will run on a embedded device must
consumes as little energy as possible.

In this repository are included a Makeile in order to do some Tests,one script for cross-compile which contains some basic steps it is further explained in the report,one Matlab script in order to get the results
and finally the program which was asked in C
